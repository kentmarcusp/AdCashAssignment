#### Adding tags
* Users are able to insert a number to the input field.
* Tags with a positive value are colored red and tags with a negative value are colored blue.
* While refreshing the page, the tags will remain saved in the browser.

#### Saving tags
* Either by clicking on the "Add tag" button or by pressing Enter, ";" or "," after typing in a number, the string gets automatically added to the list.

#### Editing
* You can edit a tag by clicking on the number value inside the borders.
* Only one tag can be edited at a time.

#### Deleting
* By pressing the "X" inside the individual tag borders, you can delete the tag.
* By pressing the "Delete all tags" button, all the tags below will be deleted.
